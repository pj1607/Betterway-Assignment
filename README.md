About Me

Hello! My name is **Pranjal**, a passionate web developer and React enthusiast.I enjoy building **clean, maintainable UI applications** with a focus on **state management, component design, and user experience**.

This project demonstrates a **mini e-commerce frontend** with features like product listing, cart management, filtering, sorting, and responsive UI.

🛒 Mini E-Commerce Product & Cart
---------------------------------

Build a small e-commerce UI using React to demonstrate understanding of:

*   Component design & React fundamentals
    
*   State management
    
*   Clean code & UX clarity
    

**Features Implemented:**

*   **Product Listing:** 15+ products displayed in a responsive grid
    
    *   Product name, price, category, stock status
        
    *   Add to Cart button (disabled if out of stock)
        
*   **Cart Functionality:**
    
    *   Add items to cart
        
    *   Remove items from cart
        
    *   Update item quantity (cannot exceed stock)
        
    *   Show total items and total price
        
    *   Auto-scroll to cart when an item is added
        
*   **Filters & Sorting:**
    
    *   Search products by name
        
    *   Filter by category
        
    *   Sort by price (Low → High, High → Low)
        
    *   Clear all filters
        
*   **UI/UX Enhancements:**
    
    *   Dark theme with accent color (#f43f5e) and subtle hover effects
        
    *   Clean buttons and interactive cart
        
    *   Smooth scroll + cart highlight when adding items
        

**Technical Constraints Followed:**

*   React functional components only
    
*   No UI libraries (Material UI, Chakra, Ant Design)
    
*   No backend (mocked product data)
    
*   CSS Modules and plain CSS for styling
    

 Tech Stack
-------------

*   **Languages:** JavaScript (ES6+), HTML, CSS
    
*   **Frameworks & Libraries:** React.js
    
*   **State Management:** React Hooks (useState, useMemo)
    
*   **Additional Tools:**
    
    *   CSS Modules for scoped styling
        
    *   Smooth scrolling with window.scrollTo
        
    *   Memoized components for performance
        

 Key Highlights
-----------------

*   Clean, responsive product grid with dynamic stock status
